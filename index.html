      <h1>My love for the Dark Souls Series</h1>
      <p>DS3: gothic, unforgiving and brilliant as ever</p>

    <h2>My favorite series - Why?</h2>
    <p>
    The masochists confirm: From Software's legendary and uncompromising dark
    RPG has as its core mission the aspiration of making all other games look ridiculously easy.
    Say hello to the constant swearing and cursing as result of playing Dark Souls III.
    Although you don't exactly say that the third game of the series shows any signs of
    smoothing - it is indeed a little more tolerant than its predecessors. So maybe, just maybe, this is the
    only accessible title in the series.
    As anyone who has played any Dark Souls game would expect, Dark Souls III is huge,
    gothic and has the best mini bosses and area bosses that look incredibly scary on
    a first encounter, you struggle, you hesitate and you keep moving as the challenge of getting through a boss fight becomes irresistibly addicting.
    Sometimes you curse, you move forward, you go back to your favorite world, as you battle
    to advance a few hundred meters. But the payoff is the triumph of getting through
    an area without losing your souls.
    Is it worth all the pain? For fans and for those looking for amazing challenges,
    the answer is yes.
    </p>
    <h2>The World of Dark Souls </h2>
    <p>
    Initially, Dark Souls III evokes memories of From Software's supposedly less
    intransigent Bloodborne, as it shares the latter's almost monochromatic color palette
    that occur in similar-looking environments, preserving all the attributes of the
    Dark Souls trademark. So you're undead, looking to track down the lords of Cinder
    who have left their thrones, in order link the fire.
    You can choose from a large number of classes, depending on whether you prefer swordplay
    and shield defense, archery, magic and so on. I first took the Pyromancer route - a class
    that is quite useful with an axe, as well as fire and dark magic of different types.
    After choosing your character, you advance the game and rest at bonfires -
    each restoring your health, stamina and respawning all enemies in the area.
    By opening up shortcuts, you cross the underworld, bring down the Lords of Cinder
    and bring their ashes back to Firelink Shrine.

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
    In terms of history, From Software has adopted, once again, the trick of providing a gloriously
    rich experience making use of cut scenes when you meet a boss. Instead, the story comes
    together from snippets of conversations collected from characters you meet along the way.
    The configurations of Dark Souls III, though always gloomy and imbued with perception, can also be diverse -
    there are castles in abundance, each more frightening than the next... medieval-style villages,
    a gloriously gloomy swamp that poisons you whenever you squelch through it and so on.
    At first, bonfires are nearby and enemies are easy to slay, but soon we encounter all different enemies
    with different types of powers and attacks, each requiring a different approach. As you die over and over again
    and return to the last rested bonfire, the game reveals twisted logic and rhythm - a feeling
    that only the best games generate.
    A patient approach is an absolute necessity - the panic dodging and attacking will only drain
    your stamina and leave you out for retaliation. And this is particularly true when you fight bosses.
    </p>
    <h2>The Veredict</h2>
    <p>
    In my opinion, Dark Souls III is From Software's best work. It's delightfully hardcore approach to game
    development, which dictates that in order to extract maximum satisfaction from their games by forcing gamers
    to make an almost superhuman efforts to be able to play the game.
    And just like it's predecessors, environmental objects are obscure and mysterious, dialogs and lore are just vague
    enough to keep gamers curious, relentlessly searching for iteams as their descriptions say a lot about the lore in general.
    The fact that it also seems inaccessibly difficult for anyone who tries to play it for the first time only goes to show
    that if you are persistet and patient, victory will prevail.
    If all of this sounds attractive, you will begin to love Dark Souls III with a passion.
    It is luring, addictive and unlike many other games today, it presents massive challenges every step of the way.
